# KanpurPython
KanpurPython is one of the growing Python Community in India. We recently completed our 1 year and 5 months. We received some great response from students as well as working professionals who live in and around Kanpu.
We have over 50 active members and still counting who work passionately for spreading Python not only in Kanpur but also the places surronding it. 


# SOME OF OUR WORK:
Recently we conducted two workshops in reputed colleges of
Kanpur named as [Allenhouse Institute of
Technology](http://www.allenhouse.ac.in/) & [Kanpur Institute of
Technology](http://kit.ac.in/)  

We are still growing and hope very soon to be one of the biggest contributor for the Python community in India.
